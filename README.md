# This is a simple script that I made when experimenting with the deployment of apps using Winget via Intune.
# It just creates a folder structure and renames the folder & files nessesary and then runs the intunewin.exe to create a .intunewin file.

# Credit to https://github.com/Romanitho for the winget intune scripts!
